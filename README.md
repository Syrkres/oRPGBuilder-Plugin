## Suggested Plugins
The code expects  certain plugins to properly format and such.
- [DataView](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) for dynamic table lists, NPC's etc
- [Markdown Attributes](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-markdown-attributes)  used for blocks
- Callouts (Obsidian Core plugin).
- - ~~[Admonitions](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition)~~ No longer required with Callouts

### Admonition Setting

### Known Issues

- Missing Rules (especially for name generation).
